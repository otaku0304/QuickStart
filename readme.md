# QuickStart

**QuickStart** is a PowerShell-based automation setup for full-stack application development, designed to make initializing frontend and backend environments seamless, especially for Angular or Node.js-based projects on Windows.

## üöÄ Features

- Automates starting backend servers and frontend frameworks.
- Supports multiple terminal setups (VS Code, Windows Terminal).
- Simple `.ps1` scripts tailored for different Windows PowerShell environments.
- Lightweight, no external dependencies.
- Structured folder setup for PowerShell 7 (`windows-ps7`) and PowerShell 5 (`windows-ps5`).

## üìÅ Current Structure

- `windows-ps7/NgBootStart`: Stable and functional. Tested with Angular apps and working as expected.
- `windows-ps5/NgBootStart`: Under development. Compatibility with legacy systems being improved.
- `windows-ps5/FlaskQuickStart`: Stable and functional. Tested with Flask app and working as expected.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Editor Launch Issues

Modern editors (like VS Code or Windows Terminal) sometimes:
- Fail to inherit shell environment variables correctly when launched via scripts.
- Open in incorrect directories unless paths are explicitly passed.
- Require administrator privileges for specific PowerShell commands.

These issues are actively being addressed and workarounds are being tested in the PowerShell 5 branch.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/otaku0304/QuickStart.git
